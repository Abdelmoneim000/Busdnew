                        To ensure sustainability and longevity of the project,
                        AND as an enhancement from the previous similar miner game,
                        the crops farmers team has implemented a feature that would
                        encourage/enforce farmers to continuously compound before taking profit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Users should compound X no. of times before they can withdraw.
                        Should a farmer decide not to compound or hire more farmers using his earnings,
                        and continuously withdraw,
                        farmer will be charged with a 80% feedback tax that will remain part of the contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Addition, to further encourage the community to re-hire/compound,
                        there will be an additional 3% bonus for each compound action that the user will do,
                        which can stack up to 40% for 10 consecutive times / 5 days. By doing so,
                        this will ensure the long term potential profit of every investor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The best strategy that the team can recommend is to re-hire/compound for 5 days and harvest 1 day a week.
                        This will increase the users investment at the same time increasing the daily yield earnings.
                        This strategy has already been tried and tested by several project and is proven effective.
